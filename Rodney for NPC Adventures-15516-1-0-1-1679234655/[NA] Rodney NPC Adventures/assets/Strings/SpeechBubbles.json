  //Quick instructions on the below. These are speech bubbles that appear above the character's head, not dialogue, so one line is recommended.
  //ambient are ambient dialogues in specific areas. Format is ambient_<area>_<charactername>, or ambient_<area>_<charactername>~1 if you want there to be multiple, randomized ones. I've left examples below of each.
  //Fight dialogues are only when fighting, which is why they are randomized to the extent they are. You don't need to have as many entries as I do here, you can delete some so the pool is lower.
  //Mostly removed the below to placeholders, but left a couple so you can see how they'd work. Also altered the keys to have RodneyOBrien so you don't have to change that part.
