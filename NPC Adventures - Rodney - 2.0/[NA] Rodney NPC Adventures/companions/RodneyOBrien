//Welcome to the final, and arguably the worst, file. You will need every file not used from your prior NPC Adventures pack here.
//You will need the name of your animations from AnimationDescriptions, your buffs values, your weapons descriptions, your i18n key for the buff description, and potentially your CompanionDisposition.
//Before continuing with this file, copy it for as many characters you have. If this is your only one, continue! Remember to replace Character with the name of your NPC.
